Description: The chipPCR package is a toolkit of helper functions to pre-process amplification data. Amplification data can be obtained from classical PCR reactions or isothermal amplification reactions. The package contains functions to normalize amplification, a simple routine to detect the start of an amplification reaction and several smoothers for amplification data. The smoothers are based on LOWESS, moving average, cubic splines, Savitzky-Golay and others. In addition contains the chipPCR package data sets of experimental nucleic acid amplification systems including the VideoScan HCU and a capillary convective PCR system. The amplification data were generated by helicase dependent amplification (HDA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under various temperature conditions. As detection system intercalating dyes (EvaGreen, SYBR Green) and hydrolysis probes (TaqMan) were used.
