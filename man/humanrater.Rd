\title{
humanrater, a graphical interface to rate curves
}
\description{
\code{humanrater} allows rating a curve for a certain characteristic in the interactive,
semi-blind manner. \code{humanrater} draws
individual graphs of a curve and prompts an input field for the user. This
function can be used to compare the human rating and the rating of a
machine.
}
\usage{
humanrater(x, cyc = 1, repeats = 1,
	designations = list(y = "yes", a = "ambiguous", n = "not"),
	shuffle = TRUE, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{x}{
is the input data (matrix or data.frame).
}
\item{cyc}{
is the index of column containing the cycle data.
}
\item{repeats}{
number of repeats to rate the samples.
}
\item{designations}{
a named list of length at least 2. See Details.
}
\item{shuffle}{
logical, if \code{TRUE} sequence of curves is shuffled for purpose of rating.
}
\item{...}{
additional arguments to \code{\link[graphics]{plot}} function.
}
}
\details{
A user can specify the list of designations characterizing the curve, where the names of
elements specify short designations used during rating. Defaults are \code{y} for "yes", \code{a}
for "ambiguous" and \code{n} for "no".
The supplied designation list must have length at least two (for example "true"/"false").

#we strongly advise against running code below using 'example(humanrater)'
#due to the highly interactive nature of this function (it would not end
#without user's input), it is recommended to just copy lines below into R

\dontrun{
  #check testdata for significance of amplification in two repeats
  human.test1 <- humanrater(testdata, repeats = 2)
  #check testdata for significance of amplification in one repeat and declare more
  #finger friendly (but less obvious) designations
  human.test2 <- humanrater(testdata, repeats = 1, list(q = "yes", w = "no"))
