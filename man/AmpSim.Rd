\title{
Amplification curve simulator
}
\description{
This function is a simple simulator of an amplification reaction based on a 
5-parameter Richards function. This simplified approach was chosen because it 
is impossible to model the shape of any amplification curve. An 
implementation of realistic models is ambitious and not conclusively 
addressed in the literature. First, they have to take ``all'' random 
effects of noise into consideration and second, they need to be generic 
enough to cover all amplification processes. More sophisticated mechanistic 
models and simulations have been proposed elsewhere \cite{mehra_2005, 
cobbs_2012}. This approach of \code{AmpSim} is similar to the 
\code{pcrsim} function from the \emph{qpcR} package, which offers 
simulations of sigmoidal qPCR data with goodness-of-fit analysis by 
Ritz and Spiess 2008.

\usage{
AmpSim(cyc = 1:35, b.eff = -25, bl = 0.05, ampl = 1, Cq = 20, 
	noise = FALSE, nnl = 0.025, nnl.method = "constant")
}

\arguments{
  \item{cyc}{
    is a vector containing the cycle values.
}
  \item{b.eff}{
    can be used to adjust the amplification efficiency.
}
  \item{bl}{
	is used to define the base level (minimum) of the background range.
}
  \item{ampl}{
    defines the plateau (maximum) of the amplification reaction.
}
  \item{Cq}{
    defines approximately the quantification point (Cq) of the amplification 
    reaction.
}
  \item{noise}{
    adds some noise to the amplification reaction.
}
  \item{nnl}{
    level of noise during the amplification reaction.
}
  \item{nnl.method}{
    trend of noise level during the amplification reaction. "constant" uses same
    noise of amplification, "decreasing" leads to less noise at the end of the 
    amplification reaction, and "increasing" leads to more noise at the end of 
    the amplification reaction.
}

\details{
\code{AmpSim} is a simple simulator for amplification reaction. 
This function has several parameters which can be used to simulate the 
amplification curve. \code{b.eff} and \code{Cq} are most connected with 
another. Thus changing one of them will change both values. \code{Cq} can be 
used to define an approximate Cq value. The expression "approximate Cq value" is 
used here because the actual Cq value is dependent on the users preferred method 
(e.g., Cy0 method, Second Derivative Maximum (SDM) method, threshold method). 
\code{AmpSim} can be used to compare an experimental system to a 
predicted model. Moreover it can be used to simulate data with noise, missing 
values (NA), signal-to-noise ratios, photo-bleaching and other influences on a 
PCR reaction.
