\details{
To perform an isothermal amplification in 'VideoScan', standard conditions for 
the IsoAmp(R) III Universal tHDA Kit (Biohelix) were used. The reaction was 
composed of 12.5 micro L buffer A containing 1.25 micro L 10x reaction buffer, 
150 nM primer (forward and reverse), 0.75  micro L template (synthetic) and 
A. bidest which was covered with 50 micro L mineral oil. The primer sequences 
for HPRT1 were taken from Roediger et al. (2013). Preincubation: This mixture 
was incubated for 2 min at 95 degree. Celsius and immediately placed on ice. 
12.5 micro L of reaction buffer B which was composed of 1.25 micro L 10x 
buffer, 40 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 1.75 micro L dNTPs, 0.2 x EvaGreen, 1 micro L 
Enzyme mix and A. bidest. The fluorescence measurement in 'VideoScan' 'HCU' 
started directly after adding buffer B at 55, 60 or 65 degrees Celsius and 
revealed optimal conditions for the amplification when using 60 or 65 degree 
Celsius. Temperature profile (after Preincubation):
- 60 seconds at 65 degrees Celsius 
- 11 seconds at 55 degrees Celsius && Measurement
