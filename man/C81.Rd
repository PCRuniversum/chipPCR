Helicase Dependent Amplification of pCNG1 using the 'VideoScan' Platform
}
\description{
A Helicase Dependent Amplification (HDA) of pCNG1 was performed. The 'VideoScan' 
Platform (Roediger et al. (2013)) was used to monitor the amplification. The 
HDA was performed at 65 degrees Celsius. Two concentrations of input DNA were 
used.

\details{

To perform an isothermal amplification in 'VideoScan', standard conditions for 
the IsoAmp(R) III Universal tHDA Kit (Biohelix) were used. The reaction was 
composed of reaction mix A)10 micro L A. bidest, 1.25 micro L 10xbuffer, 
0.75 micro L primer(150 nM final), 0.5 micro L template plasmid. Preincubation: 
This mixture was incubated for 2 min at 95 degree. Celsius and immediately 
placed on ice. Reaction mix B) 5 micro L A. bidest., 1.25 micro L 10x buffer, 
2 micro L NaCl, 1.25 micro L MgSO4, 1.75 micro L dNTPs, 0.25 micro L EvaGreen, 
1 micro L enzyme mix. The mix was covered with 50 micro L mineral oil. The 
fluorescence measurement in 'VideoScan' 'HCU' started directly after adding 
buffer B at 65 degrees Celsius. A 1x (D1) and a 1:10 dilution (D2) were tested.
Temperature profile (after Preincubation):
- 60 seconds at 65 degrees Celsius 
- 11 seconds at 55 degrees Celsius && Measurement
