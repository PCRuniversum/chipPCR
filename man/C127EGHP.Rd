qPCR Experiment for the Amplification of MLC-2v Using the Roche Light Cycler 
1.5
}
\description{
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) with a hydrolysis probe (Cy5/BHQ2) and DNA binding dye 
(EvaGreen) (Mao et al. 2007) was performed in the Roche Light Cycler 1.5 
thermo cycler. The cycle-dependent increase of the fluorescence was 
quantified at the annealing step.

\usage{data(C127EGHP)}
\format{
  A data frame with 40 observations on the following 66 variables. The first columns
  ("index") contains index of a sample and second column ("Cycle") contains the number 
  of cycle. Consecutive columns EG1-EG32 contains fluorescence data for Eva Green dye.
  Consecutive columns HP1-HP32 contains data for hydrolysis probe.
}
\details{
MLC-2v was amplified in the Roche Light Cycler 1.5. The the change of 
fluorescence was simultaneously monitored for the Hydrolysis probe of MLC-2v 
and EvaGreen. The primer sequences for MLC-2v were taken from Roediger et al. 
(2013). A 10 micro L qPCR reaction was composed of 250 nM primer (forward and 
reverse), qPCR Mix (according to the manufactures recommendations), 1 micro L 
template  (MLC-2v amplification product), 60 nM hydrolysis probe probe for 
MLC-2v. EvaGreen was used at 0.5 x final. During the amplification was 
monitored 59.5 degrees Celsius.
