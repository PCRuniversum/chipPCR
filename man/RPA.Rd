  Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) by Lutz et al.(2009)
}
\description{
Real-time amplification plot of an Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) 
by Lutz et al.(2009) in a centrifugal microfluidic foil cartridge. 
}
\usage{data("RPA")}
\format{
  A data frame with 184 observations on the following 2 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Reaction.Time}}{Reaction Time [min]}
    \item{\code{RFU}}{Relative fluorescence units [RFU]}
  }
}
\details{
The data were digitized as described by Poisot (2011). The image for data 
extraction was taken from Figure 3b by Lutz et al.(2009). The amplification 
curve present the results of a cross-contamination test of a foil disk for a 
sample containing 2000 copies of the mecA gene. For further experimental and 
technical details refer to Lutz et al.(2009).
