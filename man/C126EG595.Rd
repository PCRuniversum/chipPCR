qPCR Experiment for the Amplification of HPRT1 Using the Bio-Rad iQ5 thermo cycler
}
\description{
A quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the DNA binding dye (EvaGreen) (Mao et al. 2007) 
was performed in a Bio-Rad iQ5 thermo cycler. The cycle-dependent increase 
of the fluorescence was quantified at the annealing step (59.5 degrees Celsius).

\usage{data(C126EG595)}
\format{
  A data frame with 40 observations on the following 97 variables. The first 
  column ("Cycle") contains the number of cycles and consecutive columns 
  contain the replicates ("A01" to "H12").
}
\details{
HPRT1 was amplified in the Bio-Rad iQ5. The the change of 
fluorescence was simultaneously monitored for the Hydrolysis probe of HPRT1 
and EvaGreen. The primer sequences for HPRT1 were taken from Roediger et al. 
(2013). A 10 micro L qPCR reaction was composed of 250 nM primer (forward and 
reverse), qPCR Mix (according to the manufactures recommendations), 1 micro L 
template  (HPRT1 amplification product), 60 nM hydrolysis probe probe for 
HPRT1. EvaGreen was used at 0.5 x final. During the amplification was monitored 
59.5 degrees Celsius.
