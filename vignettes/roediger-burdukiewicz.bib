Despite the kinetic information generated by real-time {PCR}, most popular analysis methods assume constant amplification efficiency among samples, introducing strong biases when amplification efficiencies are not the same. {PMID}: 17349040},

  Abstract                 = {Micro-Total Analysis Systems (\mu{TAS}) for use in on-site rapid detection of {DNA} or {RNA} are increasingly being developed. Here, amplification of the target sequence is key to increasing sensitivity, enabling single-cell and few-copy nucleic acid detection. The several advantages to miniaturizing amplification reactions and coupling them with sample preparation and detection on the same chip are well known and include fewer manual steps, preventing contamination, and significantly reducing the volume of expensive reagents. To-date, the majority of miniaturized systems for nucleic acid analysis have used the polymerase chain reaction ({PCR)} for amplification and those systems are covered in previous reviews. This review provides a thorough overview of miniaturized analysis systems using alternatives to {PCR}, specifically isothermal amplification reactions. With no need for thermal cycling, isothermal microsystems can be designed to be simple and low-energy consuming and therefore may outperform {PCR} in portable, battery-operated detection systems in the future. The main isothermal methods as miniaturized systems reviewed here include nucleic acid sequence-based amplification ({NASBA)}, loop-mediated isothermal amplification ({LAMP)}, helicase-dependent amplification ({HDA)}, rolling circle amplification ({RCA)}, and strand displacement amplification ({SDA).} Also, important design criteria for the miniaturized devices are discussed. Finally, the potential of miniaturization of some new isothermal methods such as the exponential amplification reaction ({EXPAR)}, isothermal and chimeric primer-initiated amplification of nucleic acids ({ICANs)}, signal-mediated amplification of {RNA} technology ({SMART)} and others is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Software underpins most of our daily activities, from banking and finance to interactions with the internet, to weather forecasts and reports. Software also impacts individuals, groups, and societies through policy implementation, since information for decision and policy making is frequently derived from software ranging from climate and weather models to financial forecasting systems. One way to gauge the extent to which specific software needs to be sustainable, accessible, and transparent essentially hinges on the degree to which scientific analysis software, models, and model output are used to help inform and guide policy. Climate models and related scientific results are perhaps the most obvious example of the need for sustainable and transparent software, due in part to the public forum in which the results are scrutinized and the implications on environmental management policy. Without almost ubiquitous adoption of best practices for scientific software development, maintenance, and use, the credibility of scientific results and of ourselves as scientists is substantially at risk; sustainable and transparent research processes are thus at the heart of maintaining and increasing our collective reputations. [The authors want to make clear that, by using climate models as an example of software with policy impacts, we are not claiming that these models, are written with little “best practices” in mind, nor that they are inherently unsustainable as software.]},

Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. {MIQE} details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement. {SUMMARY}: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of {qPCR} results.},

We demonstrate that altering the melting temperature of the primers relative to the lowest temperature in the tube affects amplification efficiency; adjusting the denaturation temperature of the amplicon relative to the highest temperature in the tube affects maximum amplicon size, with amplicon lengths of ≤500 bp possible. Based on these criteria, we successfully amplified {DNA} sequences from three different viral genomes in 30 min using {CCPCR}, with a sensitivity of {\textasciitilde}30 copies per reaction.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Advances in automated {DNA} sequencing technology have greatly increased the scale of genomic and metagenomic studies. An increasingly popular means of increasing project throughput is by multiplexing samples during the sequencing phase. This can be achieved by covalently linking short, unique "barcode" {DNA} segments to genomic {DNA} samples, for instance through incorporation of barcode sequences in {PCR} primers. Although several strategies have been described to insure that barcode sequences are unique and robust to sequencing errors, these have not been integrated into the overall primer design process, thus potentially introducing bias into {PCR} amplification and/or sequencing steps. {RESULTS:} Barcrawl is a software program that facilitates the design of barcoded primers, for multiplexed high-throughput sequencing. The program bartab can be used to deconvolute {DNA} sequence datasets produced by the use of multiple barcoded primers. This paper describes the functions implemented by barcrawl and bartab and presents a proof-of-concept case study of both programs in which barcoded {rRNA} primers were designed and validated by high-throughput sequencing. {CONCLUSION:} Barcrawl and bartab can benefit researchers who are engaged in metagenomic projects that employ multiplexed specimen processing.

Although, the cycle-threshold (Ct) method is the present "gold standard", it is far from being a standard assay. Uniform reaction efficiency among samples is the most important assumption of this method. Nevertheless, some authors have reported that it may not be correct and a slight {PCR} efficiency decrease of about 4\% could result in an error of up to 400\% using the Ct method. This reaction efficiency decrease may be caused by inhibiting agents used during nucleic acid extraction or copurified from the biological sample. {PMID:} 18667053},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time {RT-PCR} has become a common technique, no longer limited to specialist core facilities. It is in many cases the only method for measuring {mRNA} levels of vivo low copy number targets of interest for which alternative assays either do not exist or lack the required sensitivity. Benefits of this procedure over conventional methods for measuring {RNA} include its sensitivity, large dynamic range, the potential for high throughout as well as accurate quantification. To achieve this, however, appropriate normalisation strategies are required to control for experimental error introduced during the multistage process required to extract and process the {RNA.} There are many strategies that can be chosen; these include normalisation to sample size, total {RNA} and the popular practice of measuring an internal reference or housekeeping gene. However, these methods are frequently applied without appropriate validation. In this review we discuss the relative merits of different normalisation strategies and suggest a method of validation that will enable the measurement of biologically meaningful results.},

However, as with {qPCR}, the ability to perform robust meaningful experiments requires careful design and adequate controls. To assist independent evaluation of experimental data, comprehensive disclosure of all relevant experimental details is required. To facilitate this process we present the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Digital {PCR} Experiments guidelines. This report addresses known requirements for {dPCR} that have already been identified during this early stage of its development and commercial implementation. Adoption of these guidelines by the scientific community will help to standardize experimental protocols, maximize efficient utilization of resources, and enhance the impact of this promising new technology.},

Reports are not generic, but have been individually designed to reflect content specific to the result type detected. Tabular output included in reports is sortable, filterable and searchable and contains context-relevant hyperlinks to external databases. Additionally, in-line graphics have been developed for specific analysis types and are embedded by default within table rows, providing a useful visual summary of underlying raw data. {ReportingTools} is highly flexible and reports can be easily customized for specific applications using the well-defined {API}. Availability: The {ReportingTools} package is implemented in R and available from Bioconductor (version ≥ 2.11) at the {URL}: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/{ReportingTools}.html. Installation instructions and usage documentation can also be found at the above {URL}. Contact: hackney.jason@gene.com or kaminker.josh@gene.com},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time reverse transcription ({RT)} {PCR} is currently the most sensitive method for the detection of low-abundance {mRNAs.} Two relative quantitative methods have been adopted: the standard curve method and the comparative C(T) method. The latter is used when the amplification efficiency of a reference gene is equal to that of the target gene; otherwise the standard curve method is applied. Based on the simulation of kinetic process of real-time {PCR}, we have developed a new method for quantitation and normalization of gene transcripts. In our method, the amplification efficiency for each individual reaction is calculated from the kinetic curve, and the initial amount of gene transcript is derived and normalized. Simulation demonstrated that our method is more accurate than the comparative C(T) method and would save more time than the relative standard curve method. We have used the new method to quantify gene expression levels of nine two-pore potassium channels. The relative levels of gene expression revealed by our quantitative method were broadly consistent with those estimated by routine {RT-PCR}, but the results also showed that amplification efficiencies varied from gene to gene and from sample to sample. Our method provides a simple and accurate approach to quantifying gene expression level with the advantages that neither construction of standard curve nor validation experiments are needed.},

  Abstract                 = {Background {EvaGreen} ({EG}) is a newly developed {DNA}-binding dye that has recently been used in quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}), post-{PCR} {DNA} melt curve analysis and several other applications. However, very little is known about the physicochemical properties of the dye and their relevance to the applications, particularly to {qPCR} and post {PCR} {DNA} melt curve analysis. In this paper, we characterized {EG} along with a widely used {qPCR} dye, {SYBR} Green I ({SG}), for their {DNA}-binding properties and stability, and compared their performance in {qPCR} under a variety of conditions. Results This study systematically compared the {DNA} binding profiles of the two dyes under different conditions and had these findings: a) {EG} had a lower binding affinity for both double-stranded {DNA} ({dsDNA}) and single-stranded {DNA} ({ssDNA}) than {SG}; b) {EG} showed no apparent preference for either {GC}- or {AT}-rich sequence while {SG} had a slight preference for {AT}-rich sequence; c) both dyes showed substantially lower affinity toward {ssDNA} than toward {dsDNA} and even lower affinity toward shorter {ssDNA} fragments except that this trend was more pronounced for {EG}. Our results also demonstrated that {EG} was stable both under {PCR} condition and during routine storage and handling. In the comparative {qPCR} study, both {EG} and {SG} exhibited {PCR} interference when used at high dye concentration, as evident from delayed Ct and/or nonspecific product formation. The problem worsened when the chain extension time was shortened or when the amplicon size was relatively long ({\textgreater}500 bp). However, {qPCR} using {EG} tolerated a significantly higher dye concentration, thus permitting a more robust {PCR} signal as well as a sharper and stronger {DNA} melt peak. These differences in {qPCR} performance between the two dyes are believed to be attributable to their differences in {DNA} binding profiles. Conclusion These findings suggest that an ideal {qPCR} dye should possess several {DNA}-binding characteristics, including a "just right" affinity for {dsDNA} and low or no affinity for {ssDNA} and short {DNA} fragments. The favorable {DNA}-binding profile of {EG}, coupled with its good stability and instrument-compatibility, should make {EG} a promising dye for {qPCR} and related applications.},

  Abstract                 = {{MOTIVATION}: Quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}) is one of the most widely used methods to measure gene expression. Despite extensive research in {qPCR} laboratory protocols, normalization and statistical analysis, little attention has been given to {qPCR} non-detects-those reactions failing to produce a minimum amount of signal. {RESULTS}: We show that the common methods of handling {qPCR} non-detects lead to biased inference. Furthermore, we show that non-detects do not represent data missing completely at random and likely represent missing data occurring not at random. We propose a model of the missing data mechanism and develop a method to directly model non-detects as missing data. Finally, we show that our approach results in a sizeable reduction in bias when estimating both absolute and differential gene expression. Availability and implementation: The proposed algorithm is implemented in the R package, nondetects. This package also contains the raw data for the three example datasets used in this manuscript. The package is freely available at http://mnmccall.com/software and as part of the Bioconductor project. {CONTACT}: mccallm@gmail.com.},

Analysis of {qPCR} data is a crucial part of the entire experiment, which has led to the development of a plethora of methods.

The survey includes 8 Microsoft Windows, 5 web-based, 9 R-based and 5 tools from other platforms. Reviewed packages and tools support the analysis of different {qPCR} applications, such as {RNA} quantification, {DNA} methylation, genotyping, identification of copy number variations, and digital {PCR}. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual software tools, such as data exchange formats, availability of a graphical user interface, included procedures for graphical data presentation, and offered statistical methods. In addition, we provide an overview about quantification strategies, and report various applications of {qPCR}. Our comprehensive survey showed that most tools use their own file format and only a fraction of the currently existing tools support the standardized data exchange format {RDML}. To allow a more streamlined and comparable analysis of {qPCR} data, more vendors and tools need to adapt the standardized format to encourage the exchange of data between instrument software, analysis tools, and researchers.},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time {PCR} is being used increasingly as the method of choice for {mRNA} quantification, allowing rapid analysis of gene expression from low quantities of starting template. Despite a wide range of approaches, the same principles underlie all data analysis, with standard approaches broadly classified as either absolute or relative. In this study we use a variety of absolute and relative approaches of data analysis to investigate nocturnal c-fos expression in wild-type and retinally degenerate mice. In addition, we apply a simple algorithm to calculate the amplification efficiency of every sample from its amplification profile. We confirm that nocturnal c-fos expression in the rodent eye originates from the photoreceptor layer, with around a 5-fold reduction in nocturnal c-fos expression in mice lacking rods and cones. Furthermore, we illustrate that differences in the results obtained from absolute and relative approaches are underpinned by differences in the calculated {PCR} efficiency. By calculating the amplification efficiency from the samples under analysis, comparable results may be obtained without the need for standard curves. We have automated this method to provide a means of streamlining the real-time {PCR} process, enabling analysis of experimental samples based upon their own reaction kinetics rather than those of artificial standards.},

  Abstract                 = {Introduction Real-time quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR)} is a well established method for the precise quantification of nucleic acids. However, there is an ongoing development of novel device concepts for {qPCRs}, hybridization and melting curve analysis. This includes lab-on-chip systems or the recently published microbead-based {VideoScan} platform [1]. Besides dedicated hardware an easy to use software for data analysis is also a requirement during developmental processes. Experimental instruments usually collect data of different formats and quality. Analysis software must therefore be able to preprocess data of different origins. Preprocessing includes data import, removal of missing values, selection of data ranges, outlier removal, detection of background signal, data transformation and smoothing /normalization of data. Subsequently, the software must be able to analyze and quantify both, the amplification and melting curve data. To automate this process we developed a set of plugins for the open source software {RKWard.} Novel technologies provide scientist with a high degree of freedom to adapt a system to specific requirements. {RKWard} provides all tools of R for an interactive data analysis and presentation, a dedicated output file and an output window for documenting results and figures. {RKWard} does not impose artificial limitations on how users can work with the application. For example, the user is not limited to using only one data.frame or one model at a time. The software aims to accelerate the development process and to enable easier collaboration between colleagues in the hardware and wetware disciplines. The plugins presented here are currently in beta stage and available upon request. In future the plugins will be provided for downloading as contributed ``plugin Packs".},

  Abstract                 = {Microbead-based technologies represent elegant and versatile approaches for highly parallelized quantitative multiparameter assays. They also form the basis of various techniques for detection and quantification of nucleic acids and proteins. Nucleic acid-based methods include hybridization assays, solid-phase {PCR}, sequencing, and trapping assays. Microbead assays have been improved in the past decades and are now important tools in routine and point-of-care diagnostics as well as in life science. Its advances include low costs, low workload, high speed and high-throughput automation. The potential of microbead-based assays therefore is apparent, and commercial applications can be found in the detection and discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphism, of pathogens, and in trapping assays. This review provides an overview on microbead-based platforms for biosensing with a main focus on nucleic acid detection (including amplification strategies and on selected probe systems using fluorescent labeling). Specific sections cover chemical properties of microbeads, the coupling of targets onto solid surfaces, microbead probe systems (mainly oligonucleotide probes), microbead detection schemes (with subsections on suspension arrays, microfluidic devices, and immobilized microbeads), quantification of nucleic acids, {PCR} in solution and the detection of amplicons, and methods for solid-phase amplification. We discuss selected trends such as microbead-coupled amplification, heterogeneous and homogenous {DNA} hybridization assays, real-time assays, melting curve analysis, and digital microbead assays. We finally discuss the relevance and trends of the methods in terms of high-level multiplexed analysis and their potential in diagnosis and personalized medicine. Contains 211 references.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of different biomolecules is of prime importance for life science research and medical diagnostics. Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, {VideoScan}, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition. The multiplex real-time capability for tracking of changes under dynamic heating conditions makes it a useful tool for {PCR} applications and nucleic acid hybridization, enabling kinetic data acquisition impossible to obtain by other technologies using endpoint detection. The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a {HEp}-2 cell assay. Its adaptiveness and versatility gives {VideoScan} a competitive edge over other bioanalytical technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {The quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR)} is the central technology for the quantification of nucleic acids. The ability to perform multiplex quantitative real-time {PCRs} ({mqPCR)} in one vessel depends on parallel read-out and high sample multiplexing. Conventional {mqPCRs} are challenging due to the lack of multiple spectral non-overlapping reporter dyes and technical limitations of the detection systems. Recently we published a highly versatile microscopy platform, designated {VideoScan}, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. It uses standard commercial hardware components together with a modular in-house developed software package. Multiplex assays can be performed in solution or on solid-phases as microbead-based assays and cell assays using conventional consumables. The system has been proven to be applicable for multiplex {qPCRs}, nucleic acid hybridization assays and melting curve analysis [1]. As we proposed earlier [2] our microbead technology in combination with {qPCR} generates a powerful technology for multiplex quantitative {PCRs.} In the present work we demonstrate our {VideoScan} technology for microbead-based multiplex quantitative real-time {PCRs.} The assay employs the interaction between gene-specific capture probes bound to thermostable microbeads and mobile gene-specific degradable detection probes which report the amplification. Our system requires only two encoding dyes for encoding of multiple microbead populations and one reporter dye for microbead bound capture probes for the discrimination of at least twelve amplification reactions. We used the method for the quantitative detection of several human and bacterial genes. The assay is amplicon size independent, requires no alteration of the {PCR} product, employs a simple probe structure and has no background fluorescence. Early results indicate that the amplification efficiency is similar to reactions in solution. ----- [1] R{\"o}diger S, Schierack P, B{\"o}hm A, Nitschke J, Berger I, Fr{\"o}mmel U, Schmidt C, Ruhland M, Schimke I, Roggenbuck D, Lehmann W \& Schr{\"o}der C A Highly Versatile Microscope Imaging Technology Platform for the Multiplex Real-Time Detection of Biomolecules and Autoimmune Antibodies.

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ({qPCR)} is a sensitive gene quantification method that has been extensively used in biological and biomedical fields. The currently used methods for {PCR} data analysis, including the threshold cycle method and linear and nonlinear model-fitting methods, all require subtracting background fluorescence. However, the removal of background fluorescence can hardly be accurate and therefore can distort results. We propose a new method, the taking-difference linear regression method, to overcome this limitation. Briefly, for each two consecutive {PCR} cycles, we subtract the fluorescence in the former cycle from that in the latter cycle, transforming the n cycle raw data into n-1 cycle data. Then, linear regression is applied to the natural logarithm of the transformed data. Finally, {PCR} amplification efficiencies and the initial {DNA} molecular numbers are calculated for each reaction. This taking-difference method avoids the error in subtracting an unknown background, and thus it is more accurate and reliable. This method is easy to perform, and this strategy can be extended to all current methods for {PCR} data analysis.},

Amplification data can be obtained from conventional {PCR} reactions or isothermal amplification reactions. The package contains functions to normalize and baseline amplification curves, a routine to detect the start of an amplification reaction, several smoothers for amplification data, a function to distinguish positive and negative amplification reactions and a function to determine the amplification efficiency. The smoothers are based on {LOWESS}, moving average, cubic splines, Savitzky-Golay and others. In addition the first approximate approximate derivative maximum ({FDM}) and second approximate derivative maximum ({SDM}) can be calculated by a 5-point-stencil as quantification points from real-time amplification curves. {chipPCR} contains data sets of experimental nucleic acid amplification systems including the {VideoScan} {HCU} and a capillary convective {PCR} ({ccPCR}) system. The amplification data were generated by helicase dependent amplification ({HDA}) or polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) under various temperature conditions. As detection system intercalating dyes ({EvaGreen}, {SYBR} Green) and hydrolysis probes ({TaqMan}) were used. The latest source code is available via: https://github.com/michbur/{chipPCR}},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Both the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and quantitative isothermal amplification (qIA) are standard methods for nucleic acid quantification. Numerous real-time read-out technologies have been developed. Despite the continuous interest in amplification-based techniques, there are only few tools for pre-processing of amplification data. However, a transparent tool for precise control of raw data is indispensable in several scenarios, for example, during the development of new instruments. RESULTS: chipPCR is an R: package for the pre-processing and quality analysis of raw data of amplification curves. The package takes advantage of R: 's S4 object model and offers an extensible environment. chipPCR contains tools for raw data exploration: normalization, baselining, imputation of missing values, a powerful wrapper for amplification curve smoothing and a function to detect the start and end of an amplification curve. The capabilities of the software are enhanced by the implementation of algorithms unavailable in R: , such as a 5-point stencil for derivative interpolation. Simulation tools, statistical tests, plots for data quality management, amplification efficiency/quantification cycle calculation, and datasets from qPCR and qIA experiments are part of the package. Core functionalities are integrated in GUIs (web-based and standalone shiny applications), thus streamlining analysis and report generation.

  Abstract                 = {{RNA} transcripts such as {mRNA} or {microRNA} are frequently used as biomarkers to determine disease state or response to therapy. Reverse transcription ({RT)} in combination with quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR)} has become the method of choice to quantify small amounts of such {RNA} molecules. In parallel with the democratization of {RT-qPCR} and its increasing use in biomedical research or biomarker discovery, we witnessed a growth in the number of gene expression data analysis methods. Most of these methods are based on the principle that the position of the amplification curve with respect to the cycle-axis is a measure for the initial target quantity: the later the curve, the lower the target quantity. However, most methods differ in the mathematical algorithms used to determine this position, as well as in the way the efficiency of the {PCR} reaction (the fold increase of product per cycle) is determined and applied in the calculations. Moreover, there is dispute about whether the {PCR} efficiency is constant or continuously decreasing. Together this has lead to the development of different methods to analyze amplification curves. In published comparisons of these methods, available algorithms were typically applied in a restricted or outdated way, which does not do them justice. Therefore, we aimed at development of a framework for robust and unbiased assessment of curve analysis performance whereby various publicly available curve analysis methods were thoroughly compared using a previously published large clinical data set (Vermeulen et al., 2009) [11]. The original developers of these methods applied their algorithms and are co-author on this study. We assessed the curve analysis methods' impact on transcriptional biomarker identification in terms of expression level, statistical significance, and patient-classification accuracy. The concentration series per gene, together with data sets from unpublished technical performance experiments, were analyzed in order to assess the algorithms' precision, bias, and resolution. While large differences exist between methods when considering the technical performance experiments, most methods perform relatively well on the biomarker data. The data and the analysis results per method are made available to serve as benchmark for further development and evaluation of {qPCR} curve analysis methods ({http://qPCRDataMethods.hfrc.nl).}},

This is especially true for the handling of the fluorescence baseline. This article shows that baseline estimation errors are directly reflected in the observed {PCR} efficiency values and are thus propagated exponentially in the estimated starting concentrations as well as 'fold-difference' results. Because of the unknown origin and kinetics of the baseline fluorescence, the fluorescence values monitored in the initial cycles of the {PCR} reaction cannot be used to estimate a useful baseline value. An algorithm that estimates the baseline by reconstructing the log-linear phase downward from the early plateau phase of the {PCR} reaction was developed and shown to lead to very reproducible {PCR} efficiency values. {PCR} efficiency values were determined per sample by fitting a regression line to a subset of data points in the log-linear phase. The variability, as well as the bias, in {qPCR} results was significantly reduced when the mean of these {PCR} efficiencies per amplicon was used in the calculation of an estimate of the starting concentration per sample.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Based upon defining a common reference point, current real-time quantitative {PCR} technologies compare relative differences in amplification profile position. As such, absolute quantification requires construction of target-specific standard curves that are highly resource intensive and prone to introducing quantitative errors. Sigmoidal modeling using nonlinear regression has previously demonstrated that absolute quantification can be accomplished without standard curves; however, quantitative errors caused by distortions within the plateau phase have impeded effective implementation of this alternative approach. {RESULTS:} Recognition that amplification rate is linearly correlated to amplicon quantity led to the derivation of two sigmoid functions that allow target quantification via linear regression analysis. In addition to circumventing quantitative errors produced by plateau distortions, this approach allows the amplification efficiency within individual amplification reactions to be determined. Absolute quantification is accomplished by first converting individual fluorescence readings into target quantity expressed in fluorescence units, followed by conversion into the number of target molecules via optical calibration. Founded upon expressing reaction fluorescence in relation to amplicon {DNA} mass, a seminal element of this study was to implement optical calibration using lambda {gDNA} as a universal quantitative standard. Not only does this eliminate the need to prepare target-specific quantitative standards, it relegates establishment of quantitative scale to a single, highly defined entity. The quantitative competency of this approach was assessed by exploiting "limiting dilution assay" for absolute quantification, which provided an independent gold standard from which to verify quantitative accuracy. This yielded substantive corroborating evidence that absolute accuracies of +/- 25\% can be routinely achieved. Comparison with the {LinReg} and Miner automated {qPCR} data processing packages further demonstrated the superior performance of this kinetic-based methodology. {CONCLUSION:} Called "linear regression of efficiency" or {LRE}, this novel kinetic approach confers the ability to conduct high-capacity absolute quantification with unprecedented quality control capabilities. The computational simplicity and recursive nature of {LRE} quantification also makes it amenable to software implementation, as demonstrated by a prototypic Java program that automates data analysis. This in turn introduces the prospect of conducting absolute quantification with little additional effort beyond that required for the preparation of the amplification reactions.},

Robust analysis is paramount to providing the same interpretation for results regardless of the skill of the operator performing or reviewing the work. We present a new method for analysis of real-time {PCR} data, the {maxRatio} method, which identifies a consistent point within or very near the exponential region of the {PCR} signal without requiring user intervention. Compared to other analytical techniques that generate only a cycle number, {maxRatio} generates several measurements of amplification including cycle numbers and relative measures of amplification efficiency and curve shape. By using these values, the {maxRatio} method can make highly reliable reactive/nonreactive determination along with quantitative evaluation. Application of the {maxRatio} method to the analysis of quantitative and qualitative real-time {PCR} assays is shown along with examples of method robustness to, and detection of, amplification response anomalies.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Quantification cycle (Cq) and amplification efficiency ({AE}) are parameters mathematically extracted from raw data to characterize quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) reactions and quantify the copy number in a sample. Little attention has been paid to the effects of preprocessing and the use of smoothing or filtering approaches to compensate for noisy data. Existing algorithms largely are taken for granted, and it is unclear which of the various methods is most informative. We investigated the effect of smoothing and filtering algorithms on amplification curve data. Methods: We obtained published high-replicate {qPCR} datasets from standard block thermocyclers and other cycler platforms and statistically evaluated the impact of smoothing on Cq and {AE}. Results: Our results indicate that selected smoothing algorithms affect estimates of Cq and {AE} considerably. The commonly used moving average filter performed worst in all {qPCR} scenarios. The Savitzky--Golay smoother, cubic splines, and Whittaker smoother resulted overall in the least bias in our setting and exhibited low sensitivity to differences in {qPCR} {AE}, whereas other smoothers, such as running mean, introduced an {AE}-dependent bias. Conclusions: The selection of a smoothing algorithm is an important step in developing data analysis pipelines for real-time {PCR} experiments. We offer guidelines for selection of an appropriate smoothing algorithm in diagnostic {qPCR} applications. The findings of our study were implemented in the R packages {chipPCR} and {qpcR} as a basis for the implementation of an analytical strategy.},

As a first step toward a quantitative real-time {PCR-based} multimarker diagnostic analysis of lymphomas, we have developed a method for determination of {IgLkappa:IgLlambda} ratio in clinical samples. {METHODS:} Light-up probe-based real-time {PCR} was used to quantify {IgLkappa} and {IgLlambda} {cDNA} from 32 clinical samples. The samples were also investigated by routine immunohistochemical analysis and flow cytometry. {RESULTS:} Of 32 suspected non-Hodgkin lymphoma samples analyzed, 28 were correctly assigned from real-time {PCR} measurements assuming invariant {PCR} efficiencies in the biological samples. Four samples were false negatives. One was a T-cell lymphoma, one was a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and one was reanalyzed and found lymphoma-positive by in situ calibration, which takes into account sample-specific {PCR} inhibition. Twelve of the samples were fine-needle aspirates, and these were all correctly assigned. {CONCLUSIONS:} This work is a first step toward analyzing clinical samples by quantitative light-up probe-based real-time {PCR.} Quantitative real-time {PCR} appears suitable for high-throughput testing of cancers by measuring expression of tumor markers in fine-needle aspirates.},

Precision and linearity are assessed using chi-square (χ(2)), which is the minimized quantity in least-squares ({LS)} fitting, equivalent to the variance in unweighted {LS}, and commonly used to define statistical efficiency. All methods yield Cqs that vary strongly in precision with the starting concentration N0, requiring weighted {LS} for proper calibration fitting of Cq vs log(N0). Then χ(2) for cubic calibration fits compares the inherent precision of the Cqs, while increases in χ(2) for quadratic and linear fits show the significance of nonlinearity. Nonlinearity is further manifested in unphysical estimates of E from the same Cq data, results which also challenge a tenet of all {qPCR} analysis methods - that E is constant throughout the baseline region. Constant-threshold (Ct) methods underperform the other methods when the data vary considerably in scale, as these data do.},

  Abstract                 = {For real-time monitoring of {PCR} amplification of {DNA}, quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR)} assays use various fluorescent reporters. {DNA} binding molecules and hybridization reporters (primers and probes) only fluoresce when bound to {DNA} and result in the non-cumulative increase in observed fluorescence. Hydrolysis reporters ({TaqMan} probes and {QZyme} primers) become fluorescent during {DNA} elongation and the released fluorophore remains fluorescent during further cycles; this results in a cumulative increase in observed fluorescence. Although the quantification threshold is reached at a lower number of cycles when fluorescence accumulates, in {qPCR} analysis no distinction is made between the two types of data sets. Mathematical modeling shows that ignoring the cumulative nature of the data leaves the estimated {PCR} efficiency practically unaffected but will lead to at least one cycle underestimation of the quantification cycle (C(q) value), corresponding to a 2-fold overestimation of target quantity. The effect on the target-reference ratio depends on the {PCR} efficiency of the target and reference amplicons. The leftward shift of the C(q) value is dependent on the {PCR} efficiency and with sufficiently large C(q) values, this shift is constant. This allows the C(q) to be corrected and unbiased target quantities to be obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The {NanoString} {nCounter} Platform is a new and promising technology for measuring nucleic acid abundances. It has several advantages over {PCR}-based techniques, including avoidance of amplification, direct sequence interrogation and digital detection for absolute quantification. These features minimize aspects of experimental error that hold promise for dealing with challenging experimental conditions, such as archival Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded ({FFPE}) samples. However, systematic inter-sample technical artifacts caused by variability in sample preservation, bio-molecular extraction, and platform fluctuations must be removed to ensure robust data. Results: To facilitate this process and to address these issues for {NanoString} datasets, we have written a pre-processing package called {NanoStringNorm} in the R statistical language. Key features include an extensible environment for method comparison and new algorithm development, integrated gene and sample diagnostics, and facilitated downstream statistical analysis. The package is open-source, is available through the {CRAN} package repository, includes unit-tests to ensure numerical accuracy, and provides visual and numeric diagnostics.

  Abstract                 = {The fast and reliable estimation of the genome sizes of various species would allow for a systematic analysis of many organisms and could reveal insights into evolutionary processes. Many methods for the estimation of genome sizes have already been described. The classical methods are based on the determination of the phosphate content in the {DNA} backbone of total {DNA} isolated from a defined number of cells or on reassociation kinetics of high molecular weight genomic {DNA} (c0t assay). More recent techniques employ {DNA-specific} fluorescent dyes in flow cytometry analysis, image analysis or absorption cytometry after Feulgen staining. The method presented here is based on the absolute quantification of genetic elements in a known amount (mass) of genomic {DNA} by real-time quantitative {PCR.} The method was evaluated on three different eukaryotic species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12.1 Mb), Xiphophorus maculatus (550 Mb) and Homo sapiens sapiens (2.9 Gb), and found to be fast, highly accurate and reliable.},

  Abstract                 = {The PMML package exports a variety of predic- tive and descriptive models from R to the Predic- tive Model Markup Language (Data Mining Group, 2008). PMML is an XML-based language and has become the de-facto standard to represent not only predictive and descriptive models, but also data pre- and post-processing. In so doing, it allows for the interchange of models among different tools and en- vironments, mostly avoiding proprietary issues and incompatibilities. The PMML package itself (Williams et al., 2009) was conceived at first as part of Togaware{\rq}s data min- ing toolkit Rattle, the R Analytical Tool To Learn Eas- ily (Williams, 2009). Although it can easily be ac- cessed through Rattle{\rq}s GUI, it has been separated from Rattle so that it can also be accessed directly in R. In the next section, we describe PMML and its overall structure. This is followed by a description of the functionality supported by the PMML pack- age and how this can be used in R. We then discuss the importance of working with a valid PMML file and finish by highlighting some of the debate sur- rounding the adoption of PMML by the data mining community at large.},

The ddCt package implements a pipeline to collect, analyse and visualize qRT-PCR results, for example those from TaqMan SDM software, mainly using the ddCt method.
